//! kage CLI binary.
//!
//! Layering: top of the workspace; depends on every library crate it uses.
//!
//! Without a subcommand kage opens the interactive TUI. Print mode (`-p`)
//! runs a single prompt through the agent loop, streams the reply to
//! stdout, and exits. Subcommands:
//!
//! - `list`, `resume`, `fork` and `search` work on the recorded sessions
//!   under `$XDG_DATA_HOME/kage/sessions/`.
//! - `auth` manages saved provider credentials, and `init` is the
//!   first-run setup wizard.
//! - `doctor` diagnoses the install, and `trust` trusts a project config.
//! - `models` manages the model catalog.
//! - `rpc` serves the Agent Client Protocol over stdio, and `serve`
//!   serves it over WebSocket behind a token, so editors and ACP
//!   clients drive kage locally or over the network; `serve` also
//!   serves the web client bundle at `/` from `--web-dir`. `mcp` serves
//!   the built-in tools over the Model Context Protocol and logs in to
//!   MCP servers.
//! - `completions` and the hidden `gen-manpage` generate shell and man
//!   page files.
