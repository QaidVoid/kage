//! Engine protocol: addressed events out, commands in.
//!
//! Every frontend observes the engine through [`Envelope`]s and drives it
//! through [`Command`]s. An envelope is serialized as one flat JSON object:
//! the `session` and `seq` fields sit next to the event's own `type` tag.
//!
//! Events are either durable (they describe state a client must keep, such
//! as [`LoopEvent::MessageAppended`]) or live (deltas and progress a client
//! may drop, such as [`LoopEvent::TextDelta`]). Each variant documents
//! which class it belongs to.
