//! Coroutines the Lua owner thread drives between its jobs.
//!
//! A job that would hold the owner thread for long, a provider stream
//! above all, runs its Lua function as a coroutine instead: [`drive`]
//! starts it and [`spawn`] hands the resulting future to the owner
//! loop (see [`crate::host`]), which polls it whenever it is woken and
//! runs other jobs in between. Host functions called inside such a
//! coroutine ([`is_driven`]) move their blocking work to a worker
//! thread ([`off_thread`]) and await it, so the coroutine yields
//! instead of holding the thread. Called anywhere else they block as
//! they always did, which keeps tools, commands and hooks unchanged.
