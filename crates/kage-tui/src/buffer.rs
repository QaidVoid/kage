//! Conversation buffer model.
//!
//! [`Buffer`] is an append-only list of [`Block`]s plus a scroll offset.
//! It is the source of truth the TUI's render loop walks each frame: the
//! buffer maps a streamed [`kage_core::LoopEvent`] timeline (assembled
//! by the host's `Hooks` impl) into discrete blocks the renderer can
//! lay out.
//!
//! Folding state lives on each block so the user can collapse thinking
//! blocks and tool calls without losing their content.
